This page demonstrates a step-by-step SP8D SPSC (Single-Producer, Single-Consumer) example for JavaScript and Node.js. Learn how to implement ultra-low-latency, lock-free channels for high-performance messaging in your apps.

# SP8D SPSC Example: Single-Producer Single-Consumer in JavaScript & Node.js

The classic “lock-free queue” pattern—one producer, one consumer, highest throughput, zero overhead. SPSC is the fastest possible channel mode: no locks, no contention, and cache-friendly.

<Callout type="tip" title="Why SPSC?">
  **SPSC (Single-Producer, Single-Consumer)** channels are the gold standard for
  ultra-low-latency, lock-free communication between exactly two threads or
  tasks. Use this pattern when you need maximum throughput and absolute
  ordering, with zero contention or ambiguity.
</Callout>

## Minimal SPSC Example (_Node.js or Browser_)

<Callout type="info" title="How to read this example">
  This example walks you through the simplest SPSC channel: one producer, one
  consumer, zero contention. Perfect for ultra-low-latency pipelines or thread
  handoff. The diagram below shows the data flow.
</Callout>

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Producer[Producer] -- send() --> Channel[SP8D SPSC Channel]
  Channel -- recv() --> Consumer[Consumer]
```

<sub>
  <strong>Producer</strong> uses <code>send()</code> to move data to the
  channel. <strong>Consumer</strong> uses <code>recv()</code> to receive it.
  This direct handoff is what enables SPSC's ultra-low latency and simplicity.
</sub>

```ts copy showLineNumbers
import { createChannel } from "@sp8d/core";

// Create an SPSC channel with 4 slots, each slot holding up to 16 bytes.
const { channel } = createChannel({ slots: 4, slotSize: 16, mode: "SPSC" });

// Producer sends messages
for (let i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
  // Wait if channel is full (backpressure)
  while (!channel.send(new Uint8Array([i, i * 10]))) {
    // Buffer is full, so producer waits and retries (busy-wait)
  }
  console.log("Sent:", i);
}

// Consumer receives messages
let received: Uint8Array | null;
while ((received = channel.recv()) !== null) {
  console.log("Received:", received);
}
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Busy-Wait Warning">
  The busy-wait loop (<code>while (!send)</code>) is for demonstration only. In
  production, use <code>sendAsync()</code> or a backpressure-aware event loop to
  avoid wasting CPU cycles.
</Callout>

### Async/Real-World Example

For real-world, non-blocking usage, use <code>sendAsync()</code> and the async
iterator as shown below.

```ts copy
// Producer (async)
for (let i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
  await channel.sendAsync(new Uint8Array([i, i * 10]));
  console.log("Sent:", i);
}

// Consumer (async)
for await (const received of channel) {
  console.log("Received:", received);
}
```

## What's happening?

- **Producer:** Calls <code>send()</code> in a loop—respects backpressure if the buffer is full.
- **Consumer:** Calls <code>recv()</code> repeatedly—gets every value, in order, with no races or drops.
- **SPSC Mode Guarantee:** Guarantees simple “ping-pong” correctness: no overwrites, slot loss, or ambiguity.

<Callout type="tip" title="Backpressure Handling">
  Backpressure is critical for lossless, high-throughput systems. Notice the
  producer waits (<code>while (!send)</code>) if the ring is full. This ensures
  you never lose data—even under burst conditions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="What Should I See?">
  The output below shows the expected send/receive order for this example. If
  you run producer and consumer in separate threads, the interleaving may
  differ, but all messages will be delivered in order.
</Callout>

```text
Sent: 0
Sent: 1
Sent: 2
Sent: 3
Received: Uint8Array([0, 0])
Received: Uint8Array([1, 10])
Received: Uint8Array([2, 20])
Received: Uint8Array([3, 30])
Sent: 4
Sent: 5
Sent: 6
Sent: 7
Received: Uint8Array([4, 40])
Received: Uint8Array([5, 50])
Received: Uint8Array([6, 60])
Received: Uint8Array([7, 70])
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Gotchas & Tips">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>send()</code> returns <code>false</code> when full; always check for
      backpressure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>recv()</code> returns <code>null</code> when channel is empty.
    </li>
    <li>
      For browser use, producer and consumer may be in separate threads—see
      browser recipes.
    </li>
    <li>
      For async use, see <code>recvAsync()</code> or the async iterator.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you see dropped messages, check your slot count and backpressure
      handling.
    </li>
    <li>For debugging, use diagnostics or enable verbose logging.</li>
  </ul>
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Performance Note">
  SPSC is the fastest mode, but only if you stick to the
  single-producer/single-consumer contract. If you break this contract, you may
  see data loss or protocol errors—use MPSC/MPMC for more complex patterns.
</Callout>
