SP8D is the leading open-source solution for ultra-low-latency, lock-free, real-time messaging and cross-thread communication in JavaScript and Node.js. Built for demanding AI, finance, and multi-agent applications, SP8D delivers blazing-fast, observable, and reliable data transfer for modern web and server environments.

# SP8D: Ultra-Low-Latency Lock-Free Channels for JavaScript & Node.js

> **The world‚Äôs first radically observable, lock-free, bounded protocol for cross-thread communication in browsers ‚Äî designed for next-generation AI copilots, trading platforms, and multi-agent applications.**

## What is SP8D?

<Callout type="info" title="What is SP8D?">
  The world‚Äôs first radically observable, lock-free, bounded protocol for
  cross-thread communication in browsers ‚Äî designed for next-generation AI
  copilots, trading platforms, and multi-agent applications.
</Callout>

SP8D is a breakthrough communication core for demanding front-end and AI workloads:

- **Blazing-fast, lock-free, slot-based communication** via SharedArrayBuffer and atomics
- **Truly bounded and backpressure-driven**, with guaranteed ‚Äúnever drop, never leak, never stall‚Äù
- **Battle-tested for real-time trading, ML agents, and browser-native concurrency**
- **Radically observable**: live diagnostics, transparency, and no more guessing why your system slowed down

Whether you‚Äôre wiring up AI copilots, streaming market data, or building the next layer of browser-native intelligence‚ÄîSP8D gives you tools, proof, and performance the rest of the ecosystem can‚Äôt match.

## Instant Hello World (Browser/Node)

<Callout type="info" title="Instant Hello World">
  Try SP8D instantly in your browser or Node.js with this minimal example.
</Callout>

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="hello-sp8d.ts"
import { createChannel } from "@sp8d/core";

const { channel } = createChannel({ slots: 8, slotSize: 64 }); // SPSC mode by default

// Producer
channel.send(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));

// Consumer
const msg: Uint8Array | undefined = channel.recv(); // Uint8Array([1, 2, 3])
console.log(msg);
```
