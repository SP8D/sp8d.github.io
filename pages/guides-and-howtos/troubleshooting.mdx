# SP8D Troubleshooting Guide

<Callout type="info" title="How to Use This Guide">
  This guide covers persistent buffer full, starvation, unfair access, and
  advanced diagnostics for SP8D channels. Use the scenarios below to quickly
  diagnose and resolve common issues.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Persistent Buffer Full

- Check if your consumer is too slow or your buffer is too small.
- Use diagnostics to identify bottlenecks.
- Try increasing buffer size or optimizing consumer logic.

### Starvation or Unfair Access

- Use diagnostics to check for agents that are not making progress.
- Review your concurrency pattern—consider switching to SPSC or MPSC if possible.
- Tune buffer size and retry logic.

## Advanced Diagnostics & Mythbusting

- _Myth:_ “Backpressure means data loss.”  
  _Fact:_ SP8D never drops data silently; you always get a signal and can handle it.
- _Myth:_ “Fairness is automatic in all lock-free systems.”  
  _Fact:_ Only protocols with explicit fairness mechanisms (like SP8D’s slot state machine) can guarantee it.
- _Myth:_ “Backpressure only happens in slow systems.”  
  _Fact:_ Backpressure can occur even in high-performance systems during bursts or imbalanced workloads.
- _Myth:_ “Diagnostics are only for debugging.”  
  _Fact:_ Diagnostics are essential for proactive monitoring and tuning in production.
