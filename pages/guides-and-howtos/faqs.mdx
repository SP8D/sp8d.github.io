# Frequently Asked Questions

## SharedArrayBuffer & Browser Support

**Q:** Why do I get “Cannot use SharedArrayBuffer” or see errors about browser support?  
**A:** Your browser or environment may lack SharedArrayBuffer/Atomics support, or you may need special headers (COOP/COEP). See installation requirements.

## Diagnostics & Live Monitoring

**Q:** How do I use diagnostics or monitor channel health?  
**A:** See the [Protocol Internals: Architecture Overview](/protocol-internals/architecture-overview#observability--diagnostics) for the canonical explanation of diagnostics, observability, and live monitoring in SP8D. For API usage, see the [Channel API Reference](/api-reference/channel-api).

## Backpressure & Buffer Full

**Q:** What should I do if the channel is full or backpressured?  
**A:** See [Fairness & Backpressure](/principles/fairness-backpressure) for a deep dive, and the [Protocol Internals: Architecture Overview](/protocol-internals/architecture-overview#edge-cases--robustness) for how SP8D handles full/empty buffers and backpressure.

## Protocol Errors & Debugging

**Q:** What do protocol errors or slot conflicts mean?  
**A:** See the [Protocol Internals: Architecture Overview](/protocol-internals/architecture-overview#edge-cases--robustness) for protocol error handling, slot conflicts, and recovery mechanisms.

## Async Iteration & Patterns

**Q:** Can I use async iteration with channels?  
**A:** Yes, channels support async iteration for event-driven consumption.

## Broadcasting & MPMC

**Q:** How do I broadcast or use MPMC patterns?  
**A:** Use MPMC mode for multi-producer/multi-consumer. See concurrency models for details.

## General

**Q:** Still stuck or have another question?  
**A:** Open an issue or check the docs for more details.
